         <h1>Chickpea Pancakes</h1>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>We absolutely love the tahini sauce that gets smothered over these pancakes. The kale and fennel can be swapped out for whatever else you have on hand, and the batter itself can be prepared in advance, making this a versatile recipe for your midweek meal rotation.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>  
        <ul>
             <li>Chickpea flour</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Tuscan kale</li>
            <li>1 medium fennel bulb</li>
            <li>Tahini</li>
            <li>1 can or jar of chickpeas, rinsed</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
            <li>Za'atar</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare batter by whisking the chickpea flour, 2 tbsp oil and half a cup of water before leaving to rest for at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat a cast iron skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Toss chickpeas in za'atar and fry in the skillet until crispy.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, remove stems from the kale and tear into bitesize pieces.</li>
            <li>Halve the fennel and use a mandoline to slice very thinly into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the kale into the pan with the chickpeas until wilted, then tip the chickpeas and kale into a bowl with the sliced fennel.</li>
            <li>Mix up the tahini sauce by stirring the tahini, crushed garlic and lemon juice together. It will seize up at first, but just keep stirring and add a couple of teaspoons of water at a time to thin until you have a smooth, pourable consistency.</li>
            <li>Using the same pan, fry a each pancake for around 3 minutes per side until fully cooked through.</li>
            <li>Serve each pancake with a generous portion of the chickpea, kale and fennel salad and drizzle the tahini sauce all over.</li>
        </ol>
